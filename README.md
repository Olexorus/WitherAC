# Wither Anti Cheat

Welcome to the WitherAC repository.

Unfortunately you will not find the full source code here. Because it is an Anti Cheat, I do not think that it would be beneficial to open source it.

What you will find here is the issue tracker, so if you've found any bugs or other problems, you can report that here.
This repository will also contain the code for the API, the default config file soon, and possibly more in the future.
